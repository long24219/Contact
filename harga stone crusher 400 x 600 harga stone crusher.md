According to our experience, the price of a jaw crusher with a smaller feeding size is cheaper than the one with a larger feeding size. Therefore, the price of Harga Stone Crusher 400 x 600 is relatively affordable and reasonable.</p><p>The feeding size of stone crusher is smaller than the discharging size. Usually, it is broken by a jaw crusher, and then goes through impact crusher, cone crusher, and sand making machine for shaping. The crushed stone can be screened into various sizes like 35mm,20mm,12mm, etc. for different uses.

It can be used as a primary crusher or secondary crusher for stone processing.</p><p>The motor drives the eccentric shaft to rotate through the belt pulley, making the jaw move up and down. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, which pushes the movable jaw plate to approach the fixed jaw plate, thus achieving the purpose of crushing materials. When the movable jaw moves downward, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes smaller. The movable jaw plate leaves the fixed jaw plate under the action of the pull rod and the spring, and the crushed materials are discharged from the lower opening of the crushing chamber. With the continuous rotation of the motor, the motor jaw assembly periodically crushes and discharges materials to achieve mass production.</p><p>In conclusion, Harga Stone Crusher 400 x 600 is an affordable and reasonable price option for various stone crushing needs.
