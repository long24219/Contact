The crushed stone is screened to separate the produce in different sizes by the separator. The crushed stone is conveyed to the vibrating screen for sieving.</p><p>As Pakistan's infrastructure development projects and housing schemes continue to surge, the demand for crushed stones will only continue to grow.
